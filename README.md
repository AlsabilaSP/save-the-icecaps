## My opinions about this test
The idea of a web form to sign up for a donation-driven newsletter about climate change awareness is interesting and very helpful to me. I try to make the form simple so the donators can easily fill it and decorate it with 'icy feeling'. This has been an exciting test. Thank you very much for the opportunity.
