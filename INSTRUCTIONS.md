# Hello and welcome to Save The Icecaps Inc!

We are a not-real organization looking to spread the word about our quickly dissolving polar ice reserves.

We've decided to launch a donation-driven monthly newsletter, delivered straight to your home, for our recent climate change awareness campaign. We need to **build a web form** so donators can **sign up for the newsletter** (don't worry about actually billing and charging people, we'll handle that separately).

This form needs to collect the **recipient's name** and **mailing address** so they can get their newsletter. Marketing would also like to have the customer's **gender**, **date of birth**, and/or **income level**, if possible, so they can send follow-up emails asking for more donations; this information is useless otherwise, though, so *whether or not you think we should ask for this is up to you*.

We also need to let donators decide on **how much to donate** (at least **1 Euro**) and if they want to **subscribe** to the monthly newsletter, *or* just **one-off** purchase the next edition. To make this enticing, let's use a checkbox to let people opt-out of the subscription, with some guilt-tripping text like "I hate polar bears -- select this to not opt-out of a one-off donation". This should help us get more donations!

As a proudly GDPR-compliant organization, we need to make sure the user **agrees to our terms and conditions**. To make it easier for them, pre-check the option. We care about good usability.

Oh, and before hitting "submit", make sure there's a little **preview/confirmation** area so donators know exactly **how much they are paying** (always in Euro) and **when to expect for the next issue** to arrive (for example: "We will charge you 1 234,56 € on 3.5.2021"). We plan to send out the newsletter on the first workday of every month.

This is a code test built to help us learn about your skills with:

- HTML DOM, accessibility, and semantics
- Javascript API familiarity
- Documentation
- Basic UI/UX
- Ethical-minded engineering
- Tooling stack, if you choose to use one
- Testing (optional, but preferred!
- Good use of Vue and Typescript (optional -- if you're more familiar with another stack, feel free!)

We don't expect your code to be perfect, and we don't want you to goldplate a quick test project. As such, don't worry too much about:

- Styling/visuals: just go for the bare basic requirements (feel free to use a CSS framework if you'd like).
- Excessive abstraction: this is a one-off project, so abstract as much as makes sense to you, but don't over-engineer it; readability is paramount!
- Backend/implementation: just build the web form; **the "submit" button doesn't need to do anything**.
